# NLP_topic_modelling

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that discovers relevant topics within a text. In this project will be investigate and implement various topic modeling techniques.

## Topic_Modelling
The objective of the project is to use topic modelling techniques to find the most frequent topic that was generated throughout different posts of users in different online platforms (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook). Two different techniques were applied: BERTopic and Latent Semantic Analysis/Indexing.

### The following steps will explain how to install the required library and requirements.
Firstly, posts collected must be processed to anonymize any sensitive information (people's names, geographic locations, email addresses and cell phone numbers), and any hyperlinks must be removed. This step was done with the help of the spaCy library.

### The following steps will explain how to use  NLP_topic_modelling.

#### BERTopic
The first topic modeling technique used was BERTopic. For this step the bertopic library was installed and used. BERTopic supports guided, (semi-) supervised, and dynamic topic modeling. The input received was the dataframe containing the different posts from a user over time. The output generated was the list of topic words most commonly found throughout the posts made by the user.

#### LSA/LSI
The second topic modeling technique chosen was Latent Semantic Analysis/Indexing. The library used in this step was gensim, a library specifically focused on topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. The input received was the dataframe containing the different posts from a user over time. The output generated was the list of topic words most commonly found throughout the posts made by the user.

## Aditional Functionalities
In addition to twitter and reddit, information was also extracted from Facebook and YouTube. Also, a web page was designed.

### WebPage
